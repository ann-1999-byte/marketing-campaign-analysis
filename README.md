# Marketing Campaign Data Analysis

A complete data analysis and predictive modeling project built in Python to analyze and predict customer affinity for marketing campaigns using real customer demographics and product ownership data.

---

## üß† Project Objective

To identify key factors influencing a customer's likelihood to opt for high-value marketing campaigns and build a logistic regression model to predict these decisions.

---

## üìä Dataset Description

- 1500 customer records
- 19 variables including demographics, product ownership, and campaign responses
- Target: `AFFINITY_CARD` (1 = High-value customer, 0 = Low-value customer)

---

## üîß Key Analysis & Methods

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing, blank, and invalid data
- **Data Transformation**: Categorical encoding, ordinal mapping, binarization
- **Visualization**: Histograms, bar charts, metadata summaries
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression with 83% accuracy on test data
- **Prediction App**: CLI-based app for predicting single or batch customer outcomes

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Logistic Regression Model

---

## üìÑ Documentation

Full methodology and code walkthrough included in the [Marketing Campaign Data Analysis.pdf](./Marketing%20Campaign%20Data%20Analysis.pdf)
